### 👋 Hey, I'm Senthilvelaa Palani

I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergrad @ VIT Chennai blending **AI with real-world engineering** to build meaningful, intelligent applications. 

🚀 I specialize in:
- 🤖 Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch)
- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, Gemini
- 🛠️ AI for Mechanical Engineering (FBD analyzers, APDL automation)
- 🌐 FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker, GCP

🧠 Recent Projects:
- 🎵 AI Music Generator with Meta's AudioCraft (FastAPI + PyTorch)
- 📄 DocWhiz: Chat with multiple PDFs using Gemini + LangChain
- 🧠 ECG Signal Classifier using 1D CNN – 98% accuracy
- 🤖 CAPTCHA Solver using CNN + LSTM

🔭 Currently:
- Building agentic AI apps with LangGraph and LLMs
- Exploring the future of ML in predictive maintenance and healthcare
- Looking for **internship or research opportunities in AI/ML**
