### 👋 Hi, I'm Senthilvelaa Palani

I'm passionate about building intelligent applications with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI agents** that can reason, interact, and solve real-world problems.

🧠 My current interests:
- 🔗 LLM-powered applications using LangChain, Gemini, and Agentic frameworks
- 🤖 AI agents that combine perception, reasoning, and memory
- 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and prompt engineering

💻 Also learning:
- 🌐 Full-stack web development with the **MERN stack**
- 📘 Algorithms and data structures in **Java**

🛠️ Technologies I work with:
Python • JavaScript • LangChain • TensorFlow • FastAPI • Streamlit • ChromaDB • HuggingFace • Docker • GCP
